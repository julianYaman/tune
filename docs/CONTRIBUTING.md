### 4. 💽 Install [Lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer)

### 5. 🖥️ Setup Lavaplayer

For setting Lavaplayer up, you need to create a ``application.yml`` YAML file in your Lavaplayer directory.

Here is an [example how it can look like](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example).

Run it with
```
java -jar Lavalink.jar
```
when you want to start the bot later. (you may need two terminals for testing or use `screen` on Linux for production usage)

### 7. 🖥️ Setup the database and create the table `playing_on`

You don't have to do it by hand. You can just run
```
npm run setup
```

It will automatically create the database and the table `playing_on`.

Via the console output, you will see if it was successful or if an error happened.
